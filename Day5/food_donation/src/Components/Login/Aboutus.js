              At&nbsp;&nbsp;MealMiracle, we believe that no one should go to bed hungry. Our mission is to connect
              surplus food from restaurants, cafes, and individuals with local shelters, food banks, and those in need.
              By leveraging technology, we aim to make the process of food donation and distribution seamless and
              efficient.

              We provide a user-friendly platform for restaurants, cafes, and individuals to easily donate excess food

              food to those who need it most.
